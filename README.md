# Dog-Emotion-Classification-Complete
This project is a Dog Emotion Recognition system that uses a Flask backend to predict dog emotions from uploaded videos. The Flutter app records videos, uploads them to the server, and displays the predicted emotion (e.g., happy, aggressive). It enables real-time video analysis for dog behavior classification.
