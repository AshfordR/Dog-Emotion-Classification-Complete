# Dog Emotion Classification

This project is a Dog Emotion Recognition system that uses machine learning to classify emotions in dogs based on audio and video inputs. The backend is built with Flask and the frontend is built using Flutter for mobile interaction. The system records videos of dogs, sends them to the server for prediction, and displays the predicted emotion.

## Features
